Hopefully you find [TED talks](http://www.ted.com) as inspiring and thought provoking as I do. Anyway, I came across a real gem for all researchers the other day. Now this is nothing to do with cloud storage or cloud computing. It posits the idea that in order to have a great new idea, you have to get lost and confused. Mindblowingly simple, yet insightful. Enjoy...

Now get lost.
