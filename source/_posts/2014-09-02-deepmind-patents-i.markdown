I'm sure many of you will have heard about [Google's Â£400m purchase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25908379) of [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com), a startup founded to solve Artificial Intelligence (AI). They focussed on developing algorithms that would allow machines to learn how to play computer games. It's this generality which makes their approach AI rather than Machine Learning (ML). And apparently the computer gets pretty good, eventually beating human players.

What intrigues me is how this technology works. Of course much of it is a closely guarded secret, but prior to being bought, DeepMind did file three patents, so I thought it would be interesting to read these. In this blog post, I'll be taking a look at the first of them, [US20140185959](http://www.google.com/patents/US20140185959).
